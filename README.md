## ‚ú® About this Package

<!-- LINK INTRODUCTION START -->

**Why Use Forest-Guided Clustering?**

Forest-Guided Clustering (FGC) is an explainability method for Random Forest models that addresses one of the key limitations of many standard XAI techniques: the inability to effectively handle correlated features and complex decision patterns. Traditional methods like permutation importance, SHAP, and LIME often assume feature independence and focus on individual feature contributions, which can lead to misleading or incomplete explanations. As machine learning models are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains like healthcare, finance, and HR, understanding why a model makes a decision is as important as the decision itself. This is not only a matter of trust and fairness, but also a legal requirement in many jurisdictions, such as the European Union's GDPR which mandates a ‚Äúright to explanation‚Äù for automated decisions.

FGC offers a different approach: instead of approximating the model with simpler surrogates, it uses the internal structure of the Random Forest itself. By analyzing the tree traversal patterns of individual samples, FGC clusters data points that follow similar decision paths. This reveals how the forest segments the input space, enabling a human-interpretable view of the model's internal logic. FGC is particularly useful when features are highly correlated, as it does not rely on assumptions of feature independence. It bridges the gap between model accuracy and model transparency, offering a powerful tool for global, model-specific interpretation of Random Forests.

**üì¢ New! Forest-Guided Clustering is now on arXiv**

Please see our paper [Forest-Guided Clustering - Shedding Light into the Random Forest Black Box](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2507.19455) for a detailed description of the method, its theoretical foundations, and practical applications.

## üíª How to Use Forest-Guided Clustering

<!-- LINK BASIC USAGE START -->

**Basic Usage**

To apply Forest-Guided Clustering (FGC) for explaining a Random Forest model, you can follow the simple workflow consisting of three main steps: computing the forest-guided clusters, evaluating feature importance, and visualizing the results.

```python
# compute the forest-guided clusters
fgc = forest_guided_clustering(
    estimator=model, 
    X=X, 
    y=y, 
    clustering_distance_metric=DistanceRandomForestProximity(), 
    clustering_strategy=ClusteringKMedoids(),
)

# evaluate feature importance
feature_importance = forest_guided_feature_importance(
    X=X, 
    y=y, 
    cluster_labels=fgc.cluster_labels,
    model_type=fgc.model_type,
)

# visualize the results
plot_forest_guided_feature_importance(
    feature_importance_local=feature_importance.feature_importance_local,
    feature_importance_global=feature_importance.feature_importance_global
)

plot_forest_guided_decision_paths(
    data_clustering=feature_importance.data_clustering,
    model_type=fgc.model_type,
)
```

where
- `estimator` is the trained Random Forest model
- `X` is the feature matrix
- `y` is the target variable
- `clustering_distance_metric` defines how similarity between samples is measured based on the Random Forest structure
- `clustering_strategy` determines how the proximity-based clustering is performed 

For a detailed walkthrough, refer to the [Introduction to FGC: Simple Use Cases](https://github.com/HelmholtzAI-Consultants-Munich/fg-clustering/blob/main/tutorials/introduction_to_FGC_use_cases.ipynb) notebook.


**Using FGC on Large Datasets**

When working with datasets containing a large number of samples, Forest-Guided Clustering (FGC) provides several strategies to ensure efficient performance and scalability:

* *Parallelize Cluster Optimization*: Leverage multiple CPU cores by setting the `n_jobs` parameter to a value greater than 1 in the `forest_guided_clustering()` function. This will parallelize the bootstrapping process for evaluating cluster stability.

* *Use a Faster Clustering Algorithm*: Improve the efficiency of the K-Medoids clustering step by using the optimized `"fasterpam"` algorithm. Set the `method` parameter of your clustering strategy (e.g., `ClusteringKMedoids(method="fasterpam")`) to activate this faster implementation.

* *Enable Subsampling with CLARA*: For extremely large datasets, consider using the CLARA (Clustering Large Applications) variant by choosing `ClusteringClara()` as your clustering strategy. CLARA performs clustering on smaller random subsamples, making it suitable for high-volume data.

For a detailed example, please refer to the notebook [Special Case: FGC for Big Datasets](https://github.com/HelmholtzAI-Consultants-Munich/fg-clustering/blob/main/tutorials/special_case_big_data_with_FGC.ipynb).
